## General Objective
To develop a website that allows users to search for and adopt dogs and cats currently in temporary homes in the Valle de Aburrá, facilitating contact between adopters and animal protection organizations.

## Problem Statement
In the Valle de Aburrá, many people want to adopt a pet, but information about available animals is scattered among different foundations. This complicates the adoption process, making it confusing and frustrating for interested parties. Our solution is to centralize all information in a single web application.

## Project Scope
The project will present an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that centralizes information from various foundations in the Valle de Aburrá so that users can obtain unified information and proceed with pet adoption.

If the MVP is approved, the next steps will include:

- Searching for pets by breed, age, size, gender, location, and special needs.
- Viewing detailed profiles of each pet with photos and relevant information.
- A matching system to facilitate adoption.
- Managing adoption requests and communication with adopters.

## Project Logo

## Slogan
**"Más que una adopción, es un propósito."**

## Project Product Title
**Pet Adoption Manager (PAM)**

### Why?
PAM arises from the need to simplify the pet adoption process, allowing interested parties to easily access information about various adoption points.

### What for?
With PAM, users can explore options and find their next life companion without having to visit each foundation individually.

### For whom?
It is aimed at individuals and families who wish to adopt pets, providing them with a platform to simplify the process.

## Component Architecture Model
The project's architecture uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in both the front-end and back-end.

### What is MVC?
MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a software architecture pattern that separates application logic from view logic. This pattern is divided into three main components:
- **Model**: Represents the structure of data and business logic.
- **View**: The user interface that presents data to the end user.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, managing user input and updating the Model or View accordingly.

Using MVC is important as it allows for a clear separation of responsibilities and facilitates scalability and maintenance of the software. Most modern frameworks use MVC or some adaptation of it for application architecture.

## Main Use Cases
1. **View available dogs and cats for adoption**  
   - Actor: Visitor user.
   - Flow: View the list of pets, filter by species, breed, age, etc.
   
2. **Send contact form for adoption**  
   - Actor: Visitor user.
   - Flow: Submit a contact form to adopt a pet.

3. **Pet registration by master user**  
   - Actor: Master user.
   - Flow: Register a new pet available for adoption.

4. **Master user registration**  
   - Actor: System administrator.
   - Flow: Register a new master user.

5. **Pet management**  
   - Actor: Master user.
   - Flow: Update or delete registered pets.
